<-- This could use a slower, more sumptuous, detailed work up as they
pass through the orgies. A little fan service goes a long way. Also
maybe a description of how to actually tie a handcuff knot, if you are
going to call it this title? Or is it better to leave it ambiguous?
But I like that the description of the handcuff knot, coming together
of two loops, might symbolize something in the story. I wouldn't be
able to resist pointing out that it's actually a lousy knot for actual
handcuffs... -->


How To Tie A Handcuff Knot


Their friendship had begun years ago. Friends-of-friends, at first,
actually. And then it's true that they had dated briefly when they had
first met. But that was beyond a decade ago. Through all the intervening
time (and relationships) they had stayed in touch. Not often, but
regularly. An email here, a text message there.
> him: Hey what cha been up to lately?
> her: Married! Wish you could have been here to see it.

Somehow there was always an element of flirting involved too, but it was
largely innocent:
> him: I remember how cute you looked in that yellow dress when I came
to visit you that time.
> her: Ha! you're cute. too bad I was dating that asshole then.

Sure, they stayed friends, but he hadn't seen her in at least 5 years.
Adult lives are so busy. There were always huge spans between their
visits. Even if they promised it wouldn't be so long next time. Their
lives switched separately from one gear to the next, and the sum of
their relationship could fit into the space where the slipping clutch
makes a grab for the next gear. He always felt like he couldn't even
remember what she looked like, when years had passed that way. But every
time they saw each other, they snapped right back into place.

He would say to her when he saw her: Old friends are often like that.
Years pass, and you're only the vaguest ghost in my memory, but then
you are there, you are hugging me, and it's like we were never apart.
Of course, he would think, the good came back with the bad. The same
arguments, the same ridiculous mismatched personalities between them.
The gears grind when they get close, but aren't in sync.

Last time he had seen her it had been on his turf. This time he was
visiting her - a thing he had not done in 15 years or more. Her's was a
whole different lifestyle now, with dogs, and cars, and houses. Oddly
plural, all those things, to him from a big city of small spaces.

He sees her waiting at the gate, and her smile is light and smirky. As
always. But also perfect, as was her way. As if her smile was the thing
she showed the world, while she kept her perfect tits, her perfect
ass, her perfect stomach, and her god-so-perfect pussy to herself. He
had never forgotten that pussy. Despite the flirting, they had never
reconnected that way. But he had also never forgotten. It was too much
of a wet tight fantasy of their early year just out of college. Hot
nights on a mattress on the floor of his tiny room of an apartment
shared with college buddies. She cumming so loudly, he thought the
neighbors downstairs would complain. He had a vivid memory of her riding
his cock through an orgasm. That was all buried behind that pretty smile
of hers for him.

For her, the pleasure came in teasing him. She knew how he never forgot
those days, even i she mostly had. She loved that he couldn't forget.
She let him stew in it. But rarely thought about it herself. He was a
sweet boy, even if she had other things and other men to occupy her most
of the time.

She was wearing a very short reddish-pink dress of a smooth cotton
weave. It only came down to mid thigh, a thing for this warm western
summer weather. Her pert tits pushed it forward at the chest and he
loved to think of the span they opened between them. She kissed him
lightly as soon as he saw her, and he breathed in a whole world of lust
and memory.

She grinned at him, and they held hands for a few minutes longer than
just-friends would, looking each other in the eye. She says to him:
we're going to a party tonight. You're going to love it. With my new
friends.

He knew. He just knew somehow what she was talking about. But he just
said oh yeah?

Back at her place the day was wearing down, and so was his willpower
against hers. He didn't really care. He'd follow her wherever she wanted
to go. Especially in her home town. But these sex parties - ugh. He
had been before. He knew people who did all the time. Maybe it was
a different here. Maybe sex parties really were a more universally
human thing, practiced here by strange brilliant people from a range
of backgrounds, and not a symptom of a particularly bored class of
moderately-wealthy, mostly-white people as he had always suspected.

She tried to talk him into it. She said there were all kinds of people
and he shouldn't be so prejudiced. So what if some of them had been
to Burning Man. She reminded him some of his best friends had been to
Burning Man. Just going to Burning Man doesn't mean you are an asshole.
Just going to a sex party doesn't make you comic-book-guy. She promised
him he would have fun. Promised. She was scoring solid points. Still he
balked. Then he had an idea.

Ok. I'll go. If, and only if, you'll stay with me the whole night. I
know you, you'll totally drag me to this party and run off with some
chiseled man-stone and leave me rubbing my phone in one hand and a warm
bottle of your crappy, low-alcohol beer in an another. If we're going,
I want you with me, by my side, the whole night. No matter what. Do you
have some rope?

Rope huh? Her eyes glinting. She dug around in a junk drawer, and came
up with a spool of replacement clothesline. He took this, remembering a
fairly simple knot from the Ashley Book of Knots sitting on his coffee
table - the handcuff knot. Two big loops, the line passing back through
and around itself. He slipped loop over her left wrist, and the other
around his right. She laughed at him. You're such a dork. But I suppose
nobody at a sex party should think it weird. He grinned, but to himself
this simple little loop tied an awkward social situation down, made him
feel secure. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all.

They walked to the party. Luckily, it was only 3/4 of a mile away. He
wasn't sure how they would have gotten into the car tied together like
this. It was amusing to have to stand there while she put makeup on, but
he could imagine remaining strictly tied to her could be annoying if it
meant crawling into a small car.

Besides, it was a lovely night for walking. And they could get a little
tipsy without having to walk home. She looked really good. He thought
to himself. Still in the same pinkish-red dress, still short, showing
a lot of leg, and a little cleavage. He had been wary of going to this
party earlier, but now it occurred to him that he was probably tied to
the most beautiful woman who would be there (even if she were a little
on the short side). This wasn't a state known for churning out boatloads
of the beautiful people. And she was a walking heat gun by the standards
of any state. Her competition would be weak. It could not be a bad thing
being tied to the hottest thing there.

She thought he looked passably pleasant too. In a pinstriped suit, maybe
just a little too small as was the fashion of these times. She liked
the way the narrow-legged pants gave him a stilty gait. She liked that
he was tall. She enjoyed walking close to him. And she enjoyed feeling
the rope tightly circling her wrist. Where did he learn knots like that?
The tightness of it made her feel secure. She put on a good show of
confidence to the world. But a bit of security felt good.

At the party, it was all hellos, air-kisses, and hugs for her. He smiled
awkwardly, always surprised at how shy he could feel sometimes. He was
glad they had arrived after the party was rolling along at a clip.
People were already a little drunk, and it made it easier to like them.
Easier to keep his reservations to himself. She introduces him here,
there. The handcuff knot gives them something to talk about. He's not
shy about saying that he was afraid of her running off with some random
hunk at the party. People laugh. They know it's only half a joke and
among these folks a well-tied knot is appreciated.

They meet people. A short financial professional in a three-piece suit
with an affected monocle. A long-legged former stripper wearing black
leather and boots with heels. A woman who identifies herself only as
a Wiccan in billowy black skirts. A guy with a hip-hop label. A pair
of twins. A metal-looking dude with long stringy black hair, and long
fingernails. Big bulky bikers. Or maybe they were just dressed the part.
Hard to tell.

He offers to get her a drink, but of course that means she comes with
him. He orders he something disgustingly sweet, and something bitter
for himself. They meet two men standing close to each at the bar. One
has pecs that carve out the shirt he is wearing into cliffs than hang
over his flat stomach. He's tan and tall, with a square jaw and perfect
teeth. The other seems like from some opposite end of a world full of
fitness fanatics. Skinny and slightly on the short side. Not an ounce of
fat on him, but barely any muscle either. A bicycle nut, he decides. But
he has sharp blue eyes that seem to observe small details that others
would pass over.

Idle chatter. How'd you end up tied together? The obvious question, from
short skinny racer-boy. He responds: I'm from out of town, She dragged
me to this party. I didn't want her to run off with someone like your
friend Hercules there. Lifting his bottle towards racer-boy's ripped
friend. Hercules laughs at this, but he's looking only at her.

More chatter. Another round of drinks. He talks mostly to racer-boy.
The riding is good around here? Double-digit grades around ever corner.
You gotta love to climb. He hears "climb" from racer boy at the same
time Hercules is telling her he is a mountain climber. I love climbers,
she gushes at him. Their fingers are just so thick and powerful. She's
rubbing the big man's sausage fingers in her tiny white hands.

Another round. Racer-boy's eyes seem turn, not duller, but sharper and
bluer with each drink. Pools of blue with tides that shifted to take in
everything. He sort of felt the desire to swim in them. To his side he
sees her grinning and unbuttoning Hercule's shirt to put her hand in
and run her fingers over the stereo definition. He can actually see her
hand riding over the bumps through the fabric of his shirt, her fingers
finding their way all the way down to the line of his pants.

Things blur. And now they are upstairs. Now they are sidling past
delicate drinks, through groups, her following, pacing each step, her
foot falling where his was, her tied arm flying in front of her, his
falling behind as if pointing to where it was safe for her to step. The
four of them find a bedroom, only being used lightly. Door closed, and
much quieter. He, Hercules, and racer-boy are sitting in a line on the
bed. She's sitting in Hercules lap, her legs splayed over his. His big
brown hands are sliding up her thighs, lifting that slight dress slowly
higher. They are kissing, her breasts pressed against him, her free arm
around, her fingers tracing out ribs, spine, shoulder, as if she needs
to feel the frame that holds up all that hard muscle the man carried.
Her other arm curved down to meet his hand, resting between him and
Hercules on the bed.

Racer-boy is kissing him slowly and gently. This is new to him. He
never kissed another man before. But it felt right. Probably because
racer-boy was exactly the type of beautiful man he had always thought
was attractive. Besides, those eyes.

And now he pulls away from racer-boy and watches her. She is kissing
Hercules' belly, unbuttoning his shirt, unzipping his fly. She reaches
in and pulls out a true monster from the abyss. It moves under it's own
power, threatening small and innocent things in its path. Get on your
knees and worship, for here today is revealed a new god.

She gasps, she grins. She acts the part. She melts to her knees between
Hercules' legs. She licks the head and downwards until it starts to
gleam. She takes the leviathan into her mouth, her lips slipping over
the tip like someone spreading wide to take the first bite of an apple.
Her hair drips down and flips back and forth painting his hard belly
with long delicate strokes. Her lips rise and fall along the shaft, but
it's clear she hasn't managed more than a token gesture at accepting
the beast. She's moaning, probably loudly, if not muted by such a flesh
plug.

For him tied to her, it shows up as entertainment. He feels himself
harden watching her struggle, so he turns back to racer-boy and kisses
him more deeply. He finds racer-boy's already hard cock with his free
hand and strokes him through his pants. Moans meet between their kisses.
He moves much more slowly. She might be on familiar ground with Hercules
the Climber of Mountains, but he was breaking new track here. He likes
it. He likes the feel of his own hard cock pressed against racer-boys,
and the taste of him, and the way his eyes half-close around that
blueness when he kisses.

Hercules has her up on the bed, his monster probing slowly into her
depths. Hercules grunts with basso pleasure, staring off at the wall,
still not even half into her. She's got her dress hiked up to her waist,
her legs wide and wrapped tightly around that muscled back, and she's
letting out such squelches of pleasure as each millimeter presses deeper
into her. She's pushing back against the carved wall of his chest with
her free hand, her mouth aghast, air passing seemingly only outwards, as
if forced out of her.

Racer-boy is undoing his shirt, his belt, his pants. Kisses down his
stomach, his cock freed and being stroked in that small strong hand. And
now racer-boy is going down on him, in long slow strokes, kneading his
balls gently between his finger tips. It's fantastic, his cock throbs,
his balls roll, he leans back.

She's taking Hercules like a champ. Being fucked harder now. And harder
again. The monster crushes whole cities before it, and she is a puny
fleeing human ant. His head is back and as each driving bolt plunges
deep into her, she screams out. Easily the loudest thing in the house.
Probably the neighborhood at this time of night.

He's taken up with blowjob, she with monster cock. But between them
they don't forget the cloth rope circling their wrists. Whether it was
delicate signals passing through the small unconscious muscles of their
arms and telegraphed across that line, or some larger hidden force of
the universe that allows two beings to know things without speaking,
they both simultaneously took each other's hand. His fingers sliding
between her small fingers, closing down around her hand. She, desperate
for some kind of hold, tightens against his grip. And, at that moment,
while she was being filled with the dick of a demi-god and he was on the
edge of cumming in another man's mouth, they realized they were in love.

She looks up at him, and he at her. Her eyes are wet, her mouth is
wide open still letting out screams of pleasure. Hercules leans back
and deftly lifts her and turns her tiny body, never letting her out of
the grip of his big hands, like he was twisting the throttle open on a
motorcycle. All while never removing his cock from her cunt.

This leaves her on her knees, propped up on one arm, her tied arm
stretch across in front of her, still holding his hand. He is overcome
with the need to be inside her. He pushes racer-boy away, gently, and
hunches up to his knees on the bed, his cock a throbbing wet mess from
racer-boy's attentions, held in his hand on the edge of cumming. On her
knees, her one hand in front of her in the air, resting in his hand, she
looks like some kind of supplicant at the altar of a old and serious
religion.

He puts his cock to her lips, and he head slides forward her moist lips
expanding to pass over the head, and coming together again as she slides
down the shaft. She accepts this that is offered to her, taking it in
her mouth like she needs it inside her, because she does. She needs him
inside her because she loves him. Everything else is just a game for the
evening.

Hercules likes what he sees, and starts to fuck her in long heavy
strokes, like construction equipment that tremors the earth. He slides
one of his big brown hand with those thick strong fingers over her
waist, down the flat of her stomach, and over her clean pussy to rest
his longest finger on her clit. With each driving push, he slides his
finger ever-so-lightly upon her clit, and she screams out in pleasure
around cock filling her mouth. She is breathing heavily through her
nostrils, sweat lightly shining across the curves of her body, tits
bouncing forward and backwards with each push.

Racer-boy is not so shy that he would be left out. He holds the shoulder
of her one arm still supporting her, and he hand comes up off the bed,
and find's racer-boy's cock. Her small creamy hand starts stroking
racer-boy in time with the thrusts from Hercules, all together in
one big movement of pleasure spreading across the four of them. She
now appears suspended from footings of cock, held aloft and floating
on rocks of cock that made gravity seem superfluous, even with the
always-shifting nature of her foundations, the way a certain shape of
airfoil makes that squishy liquid a firm support that holds aloft a
jumbo jet. She was in love, and flying on cock.

Inexplicably, racer-boy is wildly susceptible to the touch of her warm
little hand. His cock swells immediately as she begins stroking it. She
does her best to divide her attention equally among all the cock-love
thrusting at her. Her hand grips racer-boy's toy, sliding loosely along
it, squeezing gently as she comes to the head. She's so good with her
hand racer-boy actually cums first. His cum launching in a meteoric arc
across the space between them, slapping wetly as it lands against the
side of her tits.

She moans loudly as Hercules thrusts harder, spurred on by the action of
racer-boy's hot cum sliding down her waving breasts, pooling together
on her nipple for a moment, before it drops in a swinging line to the
bed. Hercules' finger on her clit finds a perfect harmonic rhythm,
and she begins the slow climb to an orgasm, each thrust of Hercules'
cock and slight jolt of his finger ratcheting her one more step up the
hill, and she lets out short bursts of stifled vocals with each thrust,
like a pawl clicking into place, keeping her from rolling backwards.
Higher and higher she slides, until she tilts slowly over the top of her
orgasm. Now she's shaking with pleasure, her short staccato bursts of
pleasure becoming one long sustained orgasm, that just goes on and on,
as Hercules pounds his monstrosity into her. Now holding her hips with
both hands, grinding hard against her. She's pinned on the two cocks,
both ramming into her at the same time, and when they slide back not
giving her any actual relief before they come charging into her again,
the the attack of a troop of wild wolves on some lame young caribou.

Hercules is groaning loudly, he pulls backwards, out of her, finally
letting her ease her ass down, which she does with total exhaustion and
vibrating, pleasurable relief. Hercules takes his bat in both hands,
and chokes up. Cum squeezes slowly out the end at first, and then the
monster jerks and twists in his hands, and two arcs of cum blast out of
the end, forming a narrow V as they lay down across the back of her ass.
Soon followed by one, then two more blasts, and finally, cum is just
sliding off the tip of his cock, as if someone had not closed the faucet
completely. It forms hot pools she can feel on her ass and her back, and
rolls down her hips, and the back of her legs.

Racer-boy and Hercules kneel panting with their softening dicks brushing
gently against her as she turns her focus to his cock. His cock filling
her mouth, she looks up at him, smiling lightly around his cock. He
looks down at her and smiles, but his eyes are moist with the thought
of all the years he had known her, and not realized he was in love with
her. Their hands that are tied at the wrist are clasped together. She
holds his balls in her free hand, slowly rolling them with tenderness
and love. She moves slowly, looking up at him every few seconds. He
never takes his eyes off her. He gently lays his hand of the back of
her head, and she pulls back to suck on the tip of his cock, just as he
cums. His cum fills her mouth, spreading hotly across her tongue. She
sucks gently as she swallows, and he takes her head between his hands,
repeating softly: I love you.

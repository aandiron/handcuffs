How To Tie A Handcuff Knot
A pornographic love story.


<!-- him -->

He's been friends with her for years. They had begun as
friends-of-friends. And then they had dated, briefly. Dating her had
been hot, passionate, and short. At that time to him it seemed like
neither of them were willing to admit they were taking it seriously.
So it never became serious, except that once in a while --- usually
while they were making love on the mattress on the floor of his first
apartment after school --- she would look at him while reaching orgasm,
and he felt deep fingers of passion interlocking between them.

That had been beyond a decade ago. He had dated her for maybe 6 weeks,
tops. The dating had ended when she finished school and returned to her
home town 2000 miles away from him. But he stayed in touch with her
through all those intervening years, distance, and relationships. Mostly
just a text message here, or an email there to check in with her. She
(almost) always responded.

Once in a while he would jokingly profess his undying love to her.
Actually, he was never sure if he was joking or not. She invariably
responded that he was crazy any time he did this. She would remind him
that they didn't actually get along very well in person. (She wasn't
wrong about that.) Still, there was an undeniable element of flirting in
all his interactions with her. Text messages between them would often go
something like this:

> him: I remember how cute you looked in that little yellow dress when I
> came to visit you that time.

> her: Ha! You're cute. Too bad I was dating that asshole then.

And he felt there was always more that she was not saying than what she
was.

He hadn't seen her in at least 5 years. That seemed to be the typical
span between visits. Their lives switched separately from one gear to
the next, and the sum of their relationship could fit into the space
where the clutch slips while making a grab for the next gear. When years
had passed, splitting them apart like that, he would grow to feel like
he couldn't even remember what she looked like.

The last few times he had seen her it had been on his turf. This time he
was visiting her --- a thing he had not done in 15 years or more. Her's
was a whole different lifestyle now, with dogs, and cars, and houses.
Oddly plural, all those things, to him from a big city of small spaces.

<!-- her -->

She waits for him at the airport gate. 

She too remembers those nights with him banging the lumpy mattress on
the cold floor of his bedroom. He had been pretty good at making her cum
--- he enjoying fucking hard and with passion, the way she liked it. But
she also liked to ham it up for him. She could broadcast her orgasms
loudly when she wanted to. She had liked the way he responded when she
did that. She remembers unleashing her own sound to the point where he
would tell her he worried about the neighbors complaining.

She knows he never forgot those days. She loves that he can't forget.
She likes that he kind of stews in it. But she rarely thinks about it
herself. He was a sweet boy, and she genuinely cared about him, even if
she had other things and other men to occupy her most of the time. It's
funny to her that she had initially seduced him, but he was the one who
really held on to that time they had together.

She loves teasing him --- she admits it to herself but never to him.
Today she wears a very short reddish-pink dress of a smooth cotton
weave. It only came down to mid thigh, a garment for this warm western
summer weather. Her pert tits push it forward at the chest and a lovely
dipping span opens between them. She chose that dress specifically
because it showed a little more than she normally did. She wanted him to
want her, even if she had no intention of fooling around with him.

She spots him walking towards the security gate. His gait is distinctive
and familiar. He's wearing a lot of a black, and he's tall and slim just
as she remembers him. He's dressed better though, the influence of his
giant urbane city has done it's work on him over the years. He's dropped
(most) of the young, punk-rock slobbishness, and trimmed himself out with
a degree of professionalism that she can't help but find endearing.
Still, his hair is kind of an unruly mess, and he needs a shave.

She catches his eye and grins at him. He's been smiling the whole time
as he walks in her direction, and his eyes glint when they find hers.
He looks genuinely happy to see her.

She hugs him, pressing perhaps closer than just-friends would, and she
takes his hand. They walk towards her car, chatting --- the usual fluff
about the flight and weather that has to come before they can get to
real catch-up conversation.

<!-- him -->

In her car she is still holding his hand while she drives. He loves her
smile --- it's just like he remembers it, light and smirky. But also
perfect, as was her way. As if her smile was the thing she showed the
world, while she kept her perfect tits, her perfect ass, her perfect
stomach, and her god-so-perfect pussy to herself. He had never forgotten
that pussy. Despite the flirting, they had never reconnected that way.
But he had also never forgotten. It was too much of a wet tight fantasy
of their early year just out of college. He had a vivid visual memory of
her riding his cock through an orgasm. That's what he sees in that smile
she has for him. And when she had hugged him, he picked up the smell of
her, and breathed in a whole world of lust and memory.

The talk in the car turns to plans for while he is visiting.

She says to him: 

> "We're going to a party tonight. You're going to love it. With some new
> friends of mine."

He just knows somehow what she is talking about. But he responds dumbly: 

> "Oh yeah?"

> "Yeah. Not, like, a regular party. Remember those pictures I texted you
> from that sex party where I was making out with that guy in front of
> everyone in my panties?"

> "You are suggesting it would be possible for me to forget that photo?"

> "Right. Well, some of those same people. It's not far from my house. I
> really want to go. We can leave early if you're miserable."

> "I don't really want to go to a sex party just to watch you make out
> with some other guy! You're the only person I would want to hook up with
> at a party like that."

> "Aww, you're sweet babe. But you know that's in the past. It's _not_
> happening again. You should go and just try to have fun.

He goes into a mild pout. They drive the rest of the way to her house
mostly in silence.

Back at her place the day is wearing down, and so is his willpower
against hers. He doesn't really care. He'd follow her wherever she
wants to go. Especially in her home town. But these sex parties ---
ugh. He had been before. He knew people who went all the time. Maybe it
was a different here. Maybe sex parties really were a more universally
human thing, practiced here by strange brilliant people from a range
of backgrounds, and not a symptom of a particularly bored class of
moderately-wealthy, mostly-white people, as he had always suspected.

<!-- her -->

She tries to talk him into it. She says there were all kinds of people
and he shouldn't be so prejudiced. So what if some of them had been
to Burning Man? She reminds him some of his best friends had been
to Burning Man. Just having been to Burning Man doesn't make you an
asshole. Just going to a sex party doesn't make you a nerd. She promises
him he will have fun. She scores solid points. Still he balks. Then he
proposes an idea to her.

> "Ok. I'll go. If, and only if, you'll stay with me the whole night. I
> know you, you'll totally drag me to this party and run off with some
> chiseled man-stone and leave me rubbing my phone in one hand and a warm
> bottle of your state's crappy, low-alcohol beer in an another. If we're
> going, I want you with me, by my side, the whole night. No matter what.
> Do you have some rope?"

> "Rope huh?"

She digs around in a junk drawer, and comes up with a spool of replacement
clothesline. He takes this, and explains his idea: 

> "At home I have the _Ashley Book of Knots_ on my coffee table. It's the
> classic work on knot-tying. There's one fairly simple knot that I was
> looking at just the other day --- The Handcuff Knot."

Holding the clothesline up in front of her, he forms it into two big
distinct loops, and crosses the loops over and through each other.
Grabbing the outside curves he then pulls the loops away from each other
and they tighten in the middle to form an approximation of handcuffs. He
slips a loop over her left wrist, and the other around his right, and
pulls the middle line so the loops close down around their wrists.

> "It's actually a terrible knot, considering its name --- it's easily
> picked apart by the wearer. I'll put a couple of half-hitches in it to
> keep it from coming apart."

She laughs at him.

> "You're such a dork with your knot-knowledge. But I suppose nobody at a
> sex party should think it's weird to see two people tied together."

They walk to the party. Luckily, it's only three-quarters of a mile down
the road. She wasn't sure how they would have gotten into the car tied
together like this. It had been amusing to have him standing there while
she put makeup on; but she could imagine crawling into her small car tied
together would probably be annoying. Besides, it was a lovely night for
walking. And they could get a little tipsy without having to drive home.

She thinks he looks passably pleasant. In a pinstriped suit, maybe
just a little too small as is the fashion of these times. She likes
the way the narrow-legged pants give him a stilty gait. She likes that
he is tall. She enjoys walking close to him. And she enjoys feeling
the rope tightly circling her wrist. Where did he learn knots like that?
The tightness of it makes her feel secure. She always managed to put on a
good show of confidence to the world. But a bit of security feels good.

<!-- him -->

He thinks she looks really good. Still in the same pinkish-red dress,
still short, showing a lot of leg, and a little cleavage. He had been
wary of going to this party earlier, but now it occurs to him that his
position is not so bad. This is not a state known for churning out
boatloads of the beautiful people. He tries to remember how it ranks on
the obesity index --- top three, he's pretty sure. And she would stand
out even in his home city, laden with models and the fashion-conscious
as it was. Her competition at the party would be weak. It could not be a
bad thing being tied to the most beautiful woman there.

He grins to himself. The handcuff knot was kind of a dumb gimmick, but
that simple little loop tied an awkward social situation down, makes him
feel secure. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all.

At the party, it's all hellos, air-kisses, and hugs for her. He smiles
awkwardly, always surprised at how shy he can feel sometimes. He's glad
they had arrived after the party is already rolling along. People are
already a little drunk, and it makes it easier to like them. And easier
to keep his reservations to himself. She introduces him here, there. The
handcuff knot gives them something to talk about. He's not shy about
saying that he was afraid of her running off with some random hunk at
the party. People laugh. They know her well enough to recognize it's
only half a joke, and among these folks a well-tied knot is appreciated.

They meet people. A short financial professional in a three-piece suit
with an ironic monocle. A long-legged former stripper wearing black
leather and boots with heels. A woman who identifies herself only as a
Wiccan in billowy black skirts. A guy with a hip-hop label. A pair of
blonde twins, like from some ancient gum commercial --- no detectable
irony there. A metal-looking dude with long stringy black hair, and long
fingernails. Big bulky bikers. Or maybe they just dressed the part. Hard
to tell.

He offers to get her a drink, but of course that means she comes
with him. At the bar he orders her something disgustingly sweet, and
something brown and bitter for himself. Next to them at the bar two men
chat. One has pecs that carve out the shirt he is wearing into cliffs
that hang over his flat stomach. He's tan and tall, with a square jaw
and perfect teeth. The other seems like from some opposite end of a
world full of fitness fanatics. Skinny and slightly on the short side
with his light brown, slightly curly hair trimmed short and neat. Not an
ounce of fat on him, but barely any muscle either.

<!-- her -->

With drinks secured in hand, all four of them lean at the bar. She's
standing next to the guy with the pecs. He glances away from the skinny
guy towards her. Casually, maybe innocently, at first. But she notices
him taking the small gaps in his conversation with the skinny guy as
opportunities to look around, and inevitably glancing at her. It was
only a matter of time before their eyes met.

The pecs dude is massive --- well more than a foot taller than her. She
smiles up at him, her tied hand hanging at her side, her other hand
preoccupied with her drink. She decides to pick up the thread she hears
him talking with the skinny guy about.

> "You climb huh?"

> "Yeah, for years now."

> "I _love_ climbers. Their hands are always so strong."

She takes one of his hands, and strokes one of this thick sausage
fingers between her thumb and forefinger. They are extraordinary, two
of them together are as big as her wrist. To her mind comes the image
of those powerful fingers, delicately thrust into the thinnest crack in
a smooth gray face of rock. He can probably suspend his whole body from
just one or two of those fingers. He could probably suspend her whole
body _on_ just one or two of those fingers...

Her eyes are locked to his, but her hand is slowly sliding up his arm as
she talks small things with him, over those gently hills of muscle. The
tips of her fingers trace down the curve of his chest.

> "You remind me of those storybook pictures of Hercules. What's your
name?"

> "Ha! You can call me Hercules if you want."

The skinny guy snorts.

> "If you're calling him Hercules, you can call me Mercury."

She never even looks away from her Hercules while the skinny guy is
talking.

> "Fancy that, coming to a party like this and getting lucky enough to
run into two Greek gods."

<!-- him -->

> "Roman. Hercules and Mercury were Roman gods."

Her friend says it, but then he's kicking himself. Obviously being a
smart-ass is probably not going to lubricate this grinding conversation.
But he wants her to remember who she's tied to. He switches his drink to
the hand tied to her, and drags her hand up with his so he can sip it.

> "Don't mind him. He's from the East-coast."

Hercules and Mercury nod in understanding.

> "But," 

Say Hercules turning to skinny Mercury,

> "seems we should be able to get those Roman and Greek gods right, didn't
we study them in like middle-school?"

Mercury says something about it being junior high and the conversation
veers off in an inanely dull direction.

Her friend decides the skinny guy they are calling Mercury must be
a bicycle racing nut. Or a runner. Possibly a cross-country skier.
Obsessed with something cardio-heavy for sure, with a body like that.
He enjoys that he has developed a skill of identifying people's
physical activities by their body types. A slightly different kind of
objectification for an objectification party. He likes the guy's sharp
blue eyes that seem to linger on and observe small details that others
would pass over.

More chatter. Another round of drinks. She's completely wrapped up with
Hercules, so he talks mostly to Mercury.

> "The riding is good around here?"

> "Double-digit grades around ever corner. You gotta love to climb."

He thinks of her and her obsession with climbers. He knows he's already
lost her to Hercules. Now he is completely dependent on that handcuff
knot. He tries to keep it going with Mercury. The guy is cute.

> "I ride a lot back home, but we don't have mountains like you do
around here."

> "If you want to do really long day-rides sometimes it's nice to have an
area with gently rolling hills. I find all-flat areas boring and hard on
the muscles after a while."

> "Yeah, back east, if you can get out of the cities, the landscape
is actually astonishingly beautiful, and those hills can be a real
pleasure to climb."

Another round. Mercury's eyes seem to turn not duller, but sharper and
bluer with each drink. Pools of blue with tides that shifted to take in
everything. He sort of felt the desire to swim in them. 

To his side he sees her grinning and unbuttoning Hercules' shirt to
put her hand in and run her fingers over the stereo definition. He can
actually see her hand riding over the bumps through the fabric of his
shirt, her fingers finding their way all the way down to the line of his
pants.

<!-- the bridge (remove references to "her") -->

He sure seems to be enjoying talking to that Mercury guy. She lets him
have his fun, preoccupied as she is with her walking man-meat.

Somewhere off in part of the room she can't see a noise is rising. At
first they ignore it, preoccupied with their conversation, but soon it's
drawing the attention of the whole party. Eyes glance towards it. People
are backing towards them. A central ring is forming. She's not tall
enough to see with people in front of her, but she's a curious one. She
pushes forward (her tied arm dragging behind her) and squeezes past a
few people.

A woman arrayed in what appears to be random scraps of black leather
buckled here and there, and wearing very dark lipstick and red
eye-shadow, is giving something like a speech. No, not a speech, an
introduction. She's clearly rehearsed this. It's similar to one of those
crowd warm-up talks a street performer in a big city gives to allow time
for more people to come into the group.

> "...A great performance always involves some element of risk. How many
> of you here have seen a lion tamer perform before?"

A scattering of raised hands.

> "I'm sure you've all seen it on TV. It looks like the tamer is a
> trained professional, right? It feels like he's perfectly safe, and you
> probably assume that those lions are just big kittens, raised by hand,
> familiar with their trainer and hardly dangerous, right?"

> "But I'm here to tell you --- lion taming is actually an insanely
> dangerous job. You know that stool they carry? They use that because
> by waving the four feet of the stool at the lion, they can continually
> distract the big cat's attention. Next time you see a lion tamer, watch
> the lion's eyes. You'll see them jump back and forth, up and down. The
> tamer is deliberately using the feet of the stool to draw the lions
> attention away from himself. Or herself!"

> "Lion taming is _actually_ a dangerous job. Most tamers have been mauled
> at some point. A shocking number have been killed. There is no way of
> taking the predator out of a big cat's mind. There is only distracting
> them from their instincts."

> "We are going to do something here tonight that is not a safe thing.
> There is very real risk involved, and we're going to see how far we can
> push it --- we're going to push it right up to the very edge. But first
> I need a victim --- I mean assistant! Who here has no fear of lions?"

A tall ginger woman, with hair the color of a cut tomato, dressed in a
lovely swooping gray dress and matching gray heels 3 inches high, raises
her hand.

The emcee takes her hand and leads her to the center of the circle, asks
her name, and repeats it to the party.

> "You're not afraid are you?"

The ginger woman insists she is not.

> "So you don't have a problem with me touching you, like this?"

The emcee runs her fingers up the ginger woman's belly, and roughly
grabs her small breast through her dress. The ginger woman reacts by
slipping her arm around the emcee and pulling her in for a swooping,
deep kiss. She even dips her.

> "Wow! Alright! Afraid of nothing apparently! So I've got a plan, my fair
> lady, would you be willing to get on your knees? For me?"

She does as she is asked, with some willingness. The emcee slips
her hand beneath one of her flaps of leather, and produces a pair of
handcuffs.

> "Have you been handcuffed before, my lovely lady?"

The ginger woman grins and nods excitedly, saying something to the emcee
that the rest of the party can't hear. The emcee laughs, and brings the
ginger woman's slender arms together behind her back, joining them at
the wrists with the handcuffs. The whole party is silently watching now,
and can hear the handcuffs ratchet into place.

> "Now, I need a few more volunteers. Who here is brave enough to face this
> lovely woman and try to tame her? Who is manly enough to show us all
> just how in control you are? I need brave men to come up here. Men who
> are not afraid to be a little exhibitionist. Do I have any volunteers?"

A few men step right up. But only a few. The emcee goads the audience:

> "Shyness is like a disease. It spreads from one person to another. But I
> am your cure my fellows. Trust me, and you'll be healed! I won't ask you
> to do anything you wouldn't do in the privacy of your own home. But I
> will ask that you do it quickly. What man here is horny enough to cum in
> a matter of minutes? I'll bet that's not a question you hear a beautiful
> woman asking you very often!"

A few laughs, but they quickly die away as a short woman with dark hair
holding up what can only be a large purple vibrator is yelling something
over the party and pushing her way to the front. She makes her way to
the emcee and talks to her for a second, while the emcee holds he hand
up and listens, palm to the audience. She starts laughing.

> "Alright! Seems like I was being sexist bastard when asking for men. My
> new young friend here insists that with the help of her purple-powered
> monster, she can orgasm as fast, if not faster, than any man here. And
> she'll squirt farther too! Welcome aboard! I, for one, am happy to have
> you. Now! Gentlemen --- and ladies --- are there any others here as
> brave and this young one?"

It takes some more cajoling from the emcee, but eventually she has
enough volunteers to satisfy her: seven men and the young lady. The
men are of various shapes and sizes. More than one seems the type that
looks for any excuse to take his shirt off --- muscle on muscles, a lot
of time at the gym makes them feel like they have the right to be naked
at a party like this. A couple of the men are pudgier, clearly just
party-animals with a lack of inhibition. One definitely seems to be of
the creepy type.

> "OK! Here's the rules of this game. You will all stand in a circle
> around our beautiful brave lioness. You will pull out your dicks (if you
> have them). You will look at her, you will think about how beautiful she
> is, you will picture holding those lovely little breasts in your hands,
> spreading her legs, sliding your cocks into her. You'll imagine what her
> lovely little mouth would feel like, warm and wet on your cock. And your
> goal is to cum as quickly as possible!"

The emcee slips her fingers between her breasts and pulls out a folded
plastic bag, crystal clear, and holds it in front of the ginger woman's
eyes.

> "Can you read what is printed on the bag for me?"

The ginger woman reads: 

> "To avoid danger of suffocation, keep this plastic bag away from
> babies and children. This bag is not a toy.”

The emcee continues:

> "You've all read that warning a thousand times probably, and never
> really thought anything of it --- right? Just nanny-state nonsense to
> keep lawyers employed, am I right?"

Cheers. A couple of groans. From the back some dude yells:

> "Skip the politics and get to the fucking!"

The emcee smiles at the crowd in a way that makes every audience member
feel like she's smiling at them personally. Her eyes come back to meet
the eye's of the ginger woman, which now have a look of genuine fear.

> "Now comes the taming. Now the part where this party stops being a
> children's game and moves into the danger zone. Where we take the real
> risks. This plastic bag, this tool of taming of mine, is going over this
> lovely lady's head. My volunteers: to win this game you need to cum on
> her before she passes out for lack of precious precious oxygen. The
> first to cum wins the grand prize. Anyone who doesn't cum before she
> passes out, is disqualified --- and has to leave the party! See? Real
> risks here! Are you all ready?"

The ginger woman nods, but looks nervous. The men are unzipping their
pants and pulling out their dubious weapons of various sizes and shapes.
The spunky young woman has one hand down her panties, and is holding her
big purple vibrator in the other as if it is a kitchen knife, and she is
ready to defend herself from some horror movie antagonist.

The emcee puts a reassuring hand on the ginger woman's shoulder. With
the other she shakes the bag open behind her.

> "Ready?"

The ginger woman is grabbing big gulps of air.

> "Steady..."

The volunteers each hold their respective shafts at the perpendicular,
in various states of rigor. They ring the center where the ginger woman
kneels in her gray dress. The tips wave gently around, as if a current
flows through the room and stirs the waters like a remote warm sea
garden.

> "Go!"

With a deft and fluid motion the bag slips over the head of the ginger
woman, whose warm breath instantly fogs the inside. The emcee ties the
bottom of the bag tightly around the ginger woman's neck, with a skill
that suggests practice. Immediately the pounding begins. A blur of
fists, bouncing pink and brown balls, and one steady forcefully quaking
purple pylon. The men are oddly silent, but the young woman is already
moaning loudly against her purple vibrator.

The ginger woman watches through the blur of the bag, calmly holding her
breath. She is surrounded by eight throbbing tentacles. As if some beast
from the deep has come for her, and now she faces the reckoning of its
wrath.

The emcee marches around the outside of the circle, keeping up a steady
banter of insults intended to keep the audience entertained, but also
clearly distracting the furiously pounding men. They would occasionally
crack up laughing and slow their beat when a particular barbed shaft
struck home. The emcee's eyes remain locked on the ginger woman on her
knees in the center, holding her breath against the plastic bag.

It's easy to poke fun at the men. Most of their eyes are squeezed closed
and their heads arch back. They bare their teeth with their lips pulled
back in a gaping rictus. They look so serious --- right up until the
emcee mocks their manliness and their visage disintegrates into an
open-eyed chuckle. Whenever this happens it takes them a few seconds to
re-assume their battle pose.

The ginger woman is calm now. Her eyes have closed and she kneels with a
certain kind of bravery, very erect and with poise. Her breasts thrust
forward, her hips coming back so her ass rests on her heels.

Within a minute one of the men begins to moan loudly and convulse,
drawing the attention of the party. He's a tall fellow, with short curly
salt-and-pepper hair, an excessively sculpted body, and an adorably
average cock made to look small by the size of the man it is attached
to. His average cock is a blur behind his shaking hand. His ass cheeks
clench, and he thrusts his pelvis forward. With a few long, slow, final
strokes of his hand, his cock locks and holds. Cum splits through the
air, and lays down in a thin line across the plastic bag over the ginger
woman's head, like wet snow falling from a tree.

> "We have a winner!"

The emcee holds one of the winner's muscled arms up in the air, his
other hand still holds his limp cock. He looks fatigued.

The young girl looks furious at having lost. She buries her vibrator
against her clit as she begins moaning loudly enough to hold the whole
party's attention. 

She turns to face outwards, towards the audience, and bends over with
her giant purple dildo rammed between her legs, her panties down
around her knees. Her mouth opens wide and she gasps, letting out loud
screeches of pleasure as she cums. She is forced to place one hand on
the ground to steady herself. A fine mist of lady-cum sprays all over
the face of the ginger woman, who leans into it, safely protected by the
plastic bag through which she cannot breathe. The ginger woman's tongue
presses against the inside of the bag, licking, as if she is desperate
to taste the warm jizz this adorable young girl has sprayed on her face,
but is frustratingly denied by the barrier of antiseptic plastic.

The emcee circles around and helps the young girl upright.

> "And we have a runner up! You make me proud my young friend.
> The rest of you had better cum soon! I don't know how much longer our
> lioness will last."

The ginger woman sways a little. The men move closer and beat harder.
One reaches out to fondle the ginger woman's breast. The emcee jumps
behind him and smacks his ass with a slap that echoes through the room
and leaves a red hand-print on his ass.

> "No touching! If it happens again, you're disqualified."

The emcee seems to have run out of insults. The men work double time.
The room is quiet except for the thwapping sound of cocks being stroked,
and the men's stifled groans. First one, then another, and another
cum. Streams of steaming cum loop through the air. 

Improbably, two streaks of cum manage to choose arcs that meet just over
the ginger woman's head. The gobs of cum combine in mid-air and their
tangling forces result in an off-balance load of come whirlygigging
around itself as it comes down. The ginger woman leans back slightly,
and it land on her forehead with an audible slap. Cum slips down and
traces along the face of the ginger woman, who has vacuumed out any
remaining air inside the bag.

Someone in the audience applauds.

The ginger woman is drooping. Her head leans back, and her mouth opens,
the bag sucks into her mouth creating a concave pit, which pools with
cum sliding around the surface of the bag. Cum sticks in droplets and
slides down the steep sides of the plastic bag and onto her neck and
shoulders, leaving dark spots on her gray dress. There's only two men
left now beating away.

The ginger woman's head bows forward, and cum pours off the bag forming
a puddle on the wood floor. The crowd pushes forward. Someone demands that
it be ended. The emcee steps forward, and pushes back the men still
stroking. One of them cums as she does this, and the emcee takes a hot
stream of cum all over her arm. The emcee curses him as she takes the
ginger woman's head in her arms, and presses her fingers into the cave
of her mouth, breaching the plastic bag. The ginger woman's shoulder's
fall back, and she sucks in air, the cum-covered plastic bag releasing
it's vacuum-form on her head.

Some people are applauding, some are yelling. More than a few seem
extremely upset, argument about consent and safe-words are shouted.
The emcee kneels in the middle, holding the ginger woman in her arms,
yelling back at the people yelling at her.

<!-- End bridge, to the big finish -->

Back at the bar, the foursome decide they need to go somewhere a little
more quiet, and make their way upstairs. Sidling past delicate drinks,
through groups, she follows, pacing each step, her foot falling where
her friend's was, her tied arm flying in front of her, his falling
behind as if pointing to where it was safe for her to step. The four
of them find a bedroom, only being used lightly. The door closes, and
it becomes quiet in a way that is something of a relief. Her friend,
Hercules, and Mercury are sitting in a line on the bed. 

She sits in Hercules lap, her legs splayed over his. His big brown hands
are sliding up her thighs, lifting that slight dress slowly higher. They
kiss, her breasts press against him, her free arm loops around him, her
fingers trace out ribs, spine, shoulder, as if she needs to feel the
frame that holds up all that hard muscle the man carried. Her tied arm
curves down to meet her friend's hand, resting between him and Hercules
on the bed.

Meanwhile, Mercury is kissing her friend slowly and gently. This is new
to him. He never kissed another man before. But it feels right. Probably
because Mercury is exactly the type of beautiful man he has always
thought was attractive. Besides, those eyes.

He pulls away from Mercury and watches her. She kisses Hercules' belly,
unbuttons his shirt, unzips his fly. She reaches in and pulls out a true
monster from the abyss. It moves under it's own power, threatening small
and innocent things in its path. Get on your knees and worship --- for
here today is revealed a new god.

She gasps, she grins. She acts the part. She melts to her knees between
Hercules' legs. She licks the head and moves downwards until it starts
to gleam. She takes the leviathan into her mouth, her lips slipping over
the tip like someone spreading wide to take the first bite of an apple.
Her hair drips down and flips back and forth painting his hard belly
with long delicate strokes. Her lips rise and fall along the shaft, but
it's clear she hasn't managed more than a token gesture at accepting the
beast. She's moaning --- probably it would be loudly, if not muted by
such a flesh plug.

For her friend tied to her, it is an entertainment. He feels his cock
harden watching her wrestle with her monster, so he turns back to
Mercury and kisses him more deeply. He finds Mercury's already hard cock
with his free hand and strokes him through his pants. Moans meet between
their kisses. He moves much more slowly. She might be on familiar ground
with Hercules the Climber of Mountains, but he was breaking new track
with his messenger god here. He likes it. He likes the feel of his own
hard cock pressed against Mercury's, and the taste of him, and the way
Mercury's eyes half-close around that blueness when he kisses.

Hercules has her up on the bed, his beast probes slowly into her depths.
Hercules grunts with basso pleasure, staring off at the wall, still not
even half into her. She's got her dress hiked up to her waist, her legs
wide and her calves clamped tightly around that muscled back, and she's
letting out such squelches of pleasure, as each inch passes slowly,
deeper into her. She's pushing back against the carved wall of his
chest with her free hand, her mouth aghast, air passing seemingly only
outwards, as if forced out of her.

Mercury is undoing his shirt, his belt, his pants. Kisses down her
friend's stomach, his cock freed and being stroked by Mercury's small
strong hand. And now Mercury is going down, in long slow strokes,
kneading his balls gently between his finger tips. It's fantastic, his
cock throbs, his balls roll, he leans back.

She's taking Hercules like a champ. Being fucked harder now. And harder
again. The monster crushes whole cities before it, and she is a puny
fleeing human ant. His head is back and as each driving bolt plunges
deep into her, she screams out. Easily the loudest thing in the house.
Probably even the neighborhood, at this time of night.

He's taken up with the blowjob, she with monster cock. But between them
they don't forget the cloth rope circling their wrists. Whether it is 
delicate signals passing through the small unconscious muscles of their
arms and telegraphed across that line, or some larger hidden force of
the universe that allows two beings to know things without speaking,
they both simultaneously take each other's hand. His fingers slipping
between her small fingers, closing down around her hand. She, desperate
for some kind of perch, tightens against his grip. And, at that moment,
while she is being filled with the dick of a demi-god and he is on the
edge of cumming in another man's mouth, they realized they were in love.

The line between them is stretched taught. And it always has been so.
Between the two of them, no matter who else they might be fucking,
no matter what other calamity befalls them, that line has never come
undone. And it never would.

She looks up at him, and he at her. Her eyes are wet, her mouth is wide
open still letting out a steady klaxon wail of pleasure. Hercules leans
back and deftly lifts her and turns her tiny body, never letting her out
of the grip of his big hands, like he was twisting the throttle open on
a motorcycle. All without removing his cock from her cunt.

This leaves her on her knees, propped herself up on one arm, her tied
arm stretches across in front of her, still holding her lover's hand.
He is overcome with the need to be inside her. He pushes Mercury gently
away, and hunches up to his knees on the bed, his cock a throbbing wet
hammer from Mercury's work, held in his hand on the edge of cumming. On
her knees, her one hand resting in his hand in front of her in the air,
she looks like some kind of supplicant at the altar of a venerable and
dark religion.

He puts his cock to her lips, and he slides forward, her delicate pink
lips stretching to pass over the head of his dick, and coming together
again as she slips down the shaft. She accepts this that is offered
to her, taking it in her mouth like a sacrament she needs inside her.
The thing she needs inside her as an expression of expansive love.

Hercules likes what he sees, and starts to fuck her in long heavy
strokes, like construction equipment that tremors the earth. He slides
one of his big brown hands with those thick strong fingers over her
waist, down the flat of her stomach, and over her clean pussy to rest
his longest finger on her clit. With each driving push, he slides his
finger ever-so-lightly upon her clit, and she screams out in pleasure
around the cock filling her mouth. She is breathing heavily through her
nostrils, sweat lightly shines across the curves of her body, tits
bounce forward and backwards with each push.

Mercury is not so shy that he would be left out. Holding the shoulder
of her one arm still supporting her, her hand comes up off the bed, and
find's Mercury's cock. Her small creamy hand starts stroking Mercury in
time with the thrusts from Hercules, all together in one big movement
of pleasure that transduces across the four of them. She now appears
suspended from footings of cock, held aloft and floating on rocks of
dick that make gravity seem superfluous, the way a certain shape of
airfoil turns the squishy liquid air into a firm support that holds
aloft a jumbo jet. She is in love, and flying on cock.

Mercury turns out to be wildly susceptible to the touch of her warm
little hand. His cock swells immediately as she begins stroking it. She
does her best to divide her attention equally among all the cock-love
thrusting at her. Her hand grips Mercury's toy, sliding loosely along
it, squeezing gently as she comes to the head. She's so good with her
hand Mercury actually cums first. His splurt launching in a meteoric arc
across the space between them, slapping wetly as it lands against the
side of her tits.

She groans loudly as Hercules thrusts harder, spurred on watching
the movement of Mercury's hot cum sliding down her waving breasts,
collecting together around her nipple for a moment, before dropping in a
swinging line to the bed. Hercules' finger on her clit finds a perfect
harmonic rhythm, and she begins the slow climb to an orgasm, each thrust
of Hercules' cock and slight jolt of his finger ratcheting her one more
step up the hill, and she lets out short bursts of stifled vocals with
each thrust, like a pawl clicking into place, keeping her from rolling
backwards. Higher and higher she slides, until she tilts slowly over the
top of her orgasm. Now she's shaking with pleasure, her short staccato
bursts of pleasure becoming one long sustained orgasm, that just goes on
and on, as Hercules pounds his foul monstrosity into her. Now holding
her hips with both hands, grinding hard against her. She's pinned on the
two cocks, both ramming into her at the same time, and when they slide
back, not giving her any actual relief before they come charging into
her again, like the attack of a troop of wild wolves on some lame young
caribou.

Hercules is puffing loudly, he pulls backwards, out of her, finally
letting her ease her ass down, which she does with total exhaustion and
vibrating, pleasurable relief. Hercules takes his bat in both hands,
and chokes up. Cum squeezes slowly out the end at first, and then the
monster jerks and twists in his hands, and two arcs of cum blast out of
the end, forming a narrow V as they lay down across the back of her ass.
Soon followed by one, then two more blasts. And finally, cum is just
sliding off the tip of his cock, as if someone had not closed the faucet
completely. It forms hot pools she can feel on her ass and her back, and
rolls down her hips, and the back of her legs.

Mercury and Hercules kneel panting with their softening dicks brushing
gently against her as she turns her focus to her lover's cock. His cock
filling her mouth, she looks up at him, smiling lightly around it.
He looks down at her and smiles, but his eyes are moist with the thought
of all the years he had known her, and not realized he was in love with
her. Their hands that are tied at the wrist are clasped together. She
holds his balls in her free hand, slowly rolling them with tenderness
and love. She moves slowly, looking up at him every few seconds. He
never takes his eyes off her. He gently lays his hand on the back of
her head, and she pulls back to suck on the tip of his cock, just as he
cums. His cum fills her mouth, spreading smokily across her tongue. She
sucks gently as she swallows. He takes her head in his hand and bends,
lifting her lips to his. They kiss, and he can taste his cum. He touches
his forehead to hers as he breaks the kiss, and they repeat softly to
each other:

> "I'm in love you."

<!-- To add back in? -->

<!-- from here Our lady reflects that she's better looking than either
the emcee or the ginger lady. But also reflects on how sex is ALWAYS
a performance. Eventually the story moves on to the upstairs foursome
scene. Which is like the big finish/final verse of the song. Maybe in
the last section they are "singing" together. It's no longer from one or
the others' perspective, but both of them together. -->

"To avoid danger of suffocation, keep
this plastic bag away from babies and children.
Do not use this bag in cribs, beds, carriages or
play pens. This bag is not a toy.”

Of course, he would think, the good came back with the bad. The same
arguments, the same ridiculous mismatched personalities between them.
The gears would grind when they get close, they aren't in sync.


<!-- What's the tension in this story? If it works, it's a pretty
standard will-they-or-won't-they. What might set it apart is if you can
figure out how to make it so that when he sees her getting fucked by
another guy (and vice versa) that's the thing that makes them fall in
love with each other. It shouldn't be TOO abstracted though. It should
make SENSE, somehow... Maybe something like he sees her getting fucked,
and realizes that there is nothing she could ever do that would make
him love her any less, and when his eyes meet hers she realizes he has
always loved her, and always will. Not sure if I should say these things
explicitly - it's nice if stuff like that can be inferred from the
action. -->

<!-- Maybe it turns supernatural? Maybe Hercules and racer boy ARE gods,
and it's their mere mortalness that makes our heroes fall in love? I'm
still struggling with how to handle what to call the two guys. There's
still way too many hims in this piece. Nah. This piece doesn't want
to go supernatural. Though maybe the two dudes are named Hercules and
Hermes? (Or is it Mercury?) The big guy gets called Hercules and the
skinny guy says "Ha. And you can call me Hermes." -->

<!-- The trick with this story has to be the KNOT. So from each of their
perspectives, while getting fucked, they look at the string, (maybe
stretched to the breaking point?) and realize it's ALWAYS been tied
between them. That's how they realize they are in love. Maybe say it
explicity... maybe not. -->
